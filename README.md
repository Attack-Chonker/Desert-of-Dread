# The Desert Looks Back

This is an interactive 3D horror experience built with Three.js.

## Running the Project

To run the game, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed.

1.  Open your terminal in the project's root directory.
2.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    npx live-server
    ```

3.  This will automatically open the game in your default web browser and enable live reloading, so any changes you make to the source code will be reflected immediately.
