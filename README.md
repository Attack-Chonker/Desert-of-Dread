Changelog:
This branch introduces a major overhaul and expansion of the game's environment, focusing on creating a more detailed, atmospheric, and narratively rich world.

Major Features & Changes:

Complete Gas Station Remodel:

The original gas station building has been replaced with a new model inspired by classic roadside stations, featuring a smaller main building with large glass windows.

Added a full gas pump area with a large canopy, support pillars, and four gas pumps, all styled to match the new building.

The lighting has been completely redone with red neon trim on the exterior and dim, static, eerie fluorescent lighting inside.

New Environmental Assets:

Roadside Neon Sign: A large, custom-built neon sign has been added for the gas station, featuring "GAS" and "LAST STOP" text, based on the provided reference image.

Enterable Car: A new car model with a basic interior is now parked at the gas station. The driver's side door is interactable, allowing the player to open it and enter the vehicle.

Water Tower: A large, rusty water tower has been added to the skyline to enhance the sense of desolation.

Telephone Poles: A line of telephone poles now follows the highway, making the world feel more connected and vast.

Environmental Storytelling:

Saloon: The interior is now furnished with tables and chairs. One table features an abandoned poker hand, and a nearby chair is knocked over to suggest a hasty departure.

Gas Station: A newspaper with the headline "Strange Lights Over Desert" has been placed on the interior counter.

Abandoned Car: A lone suitcase sits on the ground next to the new enterable car.

Bug Fixes & Layout Adjustments:

Corrected the interior layout of the gas station to ensure a logical flow and remove any objects that were blocking doorways or paths.

Relocated the cat and trash cans to more sensible positions on the gas station porch and side yard.
